## Usage

### Getting started

To set up this project, clone this repository and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

While developing the website, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will serve the site locally on port 3000. You can visit http://localhost:3000/ to preview the website. The Next.js development server will automatically reload the CSS or refresh the whole page, when stylesheets or content changes.

#### Styling with Prettier

Along side the development server, run:

```bash
npm run prettier-watch
```

This will use Prettier to style any files that have changed.

### Build

To build the site, use:

```bash
npm run build
```
